#California Housing Price Predictor
This is a simple Flask app that predicts the median housing prices in California based on various factors such as median income, house age, average number of rooms, average number of bedrooms, population, average occupancy, latitude, and longitude.

#Requirements
To run this app, you'll need Python 3 installed on your computer, as well as the following packages:

Flask
pandas
scikit-learn
You can install these packages by running the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
#Running the App
To run the app, simply run the following command:
python app.py
This will start a local server on your machine. You can then navigate to http://localhost:5000/ in your web browser to access the app.

#Using the App
Once you've loaded the app, you'll see a simple form where you can enter the various housing factors mentioned above. Simply enter the values you're interested in, and click the "Predict" button to see the app's predictions.

#Acknowledgments
This app was created as part of an exercise in using Flask and scikit-learn to create a simple machine learning application. It is based on the California Housing dataset, which is available through scikit-learn.
